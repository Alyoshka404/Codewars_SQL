## SQL Basics: Simple JOIN and RANK

**DESCRIPTION:**

 For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the ```people``` table, and join to the ```sales``` table so that you can return the COUNT of all sales and RANK each person by their sale_count. 
  
  
**people table schema**
* id
* name
* age

**sales table schema**
* id
* people_id
* sale
* price

You should return all people fields as well as the sale count as "sale_count" and the rank as "sale_rank".
  
<br>
<details><summary>My Solution</summary> <br>
  
>```SQL
>-- Create your SELECT statement here
>SELECT  people.id, people.name, COUNT(sales.sale) AS sale_count,
>        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY people.id ORDER BY people.id DESC) AS sale_rank

## SQL Basics - Monsters using CASE

**DESCRIPTION:**

You have access to two tables named top_half and bottom_half, as follows:

**top_half schema**
* id
* heads
* arms

**bottom_half schema**
* id
* legs
* tails

  
You must return a table with the format as follows:
  
  
**output schema**
* id
* heads
* legs
* arms
* tails
* species
  
  
The IDs on the tables match to make a full monster. For heads, arms, legs and tails you need to draw in the data from each table.

For the species, if the monster has more heads than arms, more tails than legs, or both, it is a 'BEAST' else it is a 'WEIRDO'. This needs to be captured in the species column.

All rows should be returned (10).

Tests require the use of CASE. Order by species.

Please use pure SQL, only testing is done in Ruby.

>                        ON top_half.id = bottom_half.id)
>
>SELECT *,
>        CASE WHEN (heads > arms) OR (tails > legs)

## SQL Basics: Simple UNION ALL

**DESCRIPTION:**

  For this challenge you need to create a UNION statement, there are two tables ```ussales``` and ```eusales``` the parent company tracks each sale at its respective location in each table, you must all filter the sale price so it only returns rows with a sale greater than ```50.00```. You have been tasked with combining that data for future analysis. Order by location (US before EU), then by id.
  
  
  
**(us/eu)sales table schema**
* id
* name
* price
* card_name
* card_number
* transaction_date

**resultant table schema**
* location (EU for eusales and US for ussales)
* id
* name
* price (greater than 50.00)
* card_name
* card_number
* transaction_date
  
<br>
<details><summary>My Solution</summary> <br>

## SQL Basics: Simple table totaling.

**DESCRIPTION:**

For this challenge you need to create a simple query to display each unique clan with their total points and ranked by their total points.  
  
**people table schema**
* name
* points
* clan

 You should then return a table that resembles below 
  
**select on**
* rank
* clan
* total_points
* total_people


The query must rank each clan by their total_points, you must return each unqiue clan and if there is no clan name (i.e. it's an empty string) you must replace it with ```[no clan specified]```, you must sum the total_points for each clan and the total_people within that clan.

##Note The data is loaded from the live leaderboard, this means values will change but also could cause the kata to time out retreiving the information.

## Conditional Count

**DESCRIPTION:**

 Given a ```payment``` table, which is a part of DVD Rental Sample Database, with the following schema 

Column       | Type                        | Modifiers
-------------| ----------------------------| ----------
payment_id   | integer                     | not null 
customer_id  | smallint                    | not null
staff_id     | smallint                    | not null
rental_id    | integer                     | not null
amount       | numeric(5,2)                | not null
payment_date | timestamp without time zone | not null  
  
 produce a result set for the report that shows a side-by-side comparison of the number and total amounts of payments made in Mike's and Jon's stores broken down by months.

The resulting data set should be ordered by ```month``` using natural order (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.).

Note: *You don't need to worry about the year component. Months are never repeated because the sample data set contains payment information only for one year.*

The desired output for the report 
  
 month | total_count | total_amount | mike_count | mike_amount | jon_count | jon_amount
-------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|-----------|------------
2      |             |              |            |             |           |           
5      |             |              |            |             |           |           
... 
  
 
* ```month``` - number of the month (1 - January, 2 - February, etc.)
* ```total_count``` - total number of payments
* ```total_amount``` - total payment amount
* ```mike_count``` - total number of payments accepted by Mike (```staff_id = 1```)
* ```mike_amount``` - total amount of payments accepted by Mike (```staff_id = 1```)
* ```jon_count``` - total number of payments accepted by Jon (```staff_id = 2```)
* ```jon_amount``` - total amount of payments accepted by Jon (```staff_id = 2```)

## Calculating Batting Average

**DESCRIPTION:**

In baseball, the batting average is a simple and most common way to measure a hitter's performace. Batting average is calculated by taking all the players ```hits``` and dividing it by their number of ```at_bats```, and it is usually displayed as a 3 digit decimal (i.e. 0.300).

Given a ```yankees``` table with the following schema,

-```player_id``` STRING

-```player_name``` STRING

-```primary_position``` STRING

-```games``` INTEGER

-```at_bats``` INTEGER

-```hits``` INTEGER

return a table with ```player_name```, ```games```, and ```batting_average```.

We want ```batting_average``` to be rounded to the nearest thousandth, since that is how baseball fans are used to seeing it. Format it as text and make sure it has 3 digits to the right of the decimal (pad with zeroes if neccesary).

Next, order our resulting table by ```batting_average```, with the highest average in the first row.

Finally, since ```batting_average``` is a rate statistic, a small number of ```at_bats``` can change the average dramatically. To correct for this, exclude any player who doesn't have at least 100 at bats.

Expected Output Table

-```player_name``` STRING

-```games``` INTEGER

-```batting_average``` STRING

## Analyzing the sales by product and date

**DESCRIPTION:**

  
**Task**
Given the information about sales in a store, calculate the total revenue for each day, month, year, and product.

**Notes**
* The ```sales``` table stores only the dates for which any data has been recorded - the information about individual sales (what was sold, and when) is stored in the ```sales_details``` table instead
* The ```sales_details``` table stores totals per product per date
* Order the result by the ```product_name```, ```year```, ```month```, ```day``` columns
* We're interested only in the product-specific data, so you shouldn't return the total revenue from all sales
  

**Input tables**  
  

|    Table      |   Column   |  Type   |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| products      | id         | int     |
|               | name       | text    |
|               | price      | numeric |

| sales         | id         | int     |
|               | date       | date    |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| sales_details | id         | int     |
|               | sale_id    | int     |
|               | product_id | int     |
|               | count      | int     |
 
  
**Output table**

## Present JSON data the SQL way

**DESCRIPTION:**

**Task**
Given the database where users are stored in JSON format, fetch the records splitting the data into separate columns.

**Notes**
* The ```private``` field determines whether the user's email address should be publicly visible
* If the profile is private, ```email_address``` should equal ```"Hidden"```
* The users may have multiple email addresses
* If no email addresses are provided, ```email_address``` should equal ```"None"```
* If there're multiple email addresses, the first one should be shown
* The ```date_of_birth``` is in the ```yyyy-mm-dd``` format
* The ```age``` fields represents the user's age in years
* Order the result by the ```first_name```, and ```last_name``` columns
